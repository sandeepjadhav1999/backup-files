************USESTATE***************

things to knw about:

*) we use state system whnever we want to update content on the screen
*) it is called useState
*) the first argument to the useState is the "state"
*) the second argument used in useSTate is the setter function 
*) we can assign default value to the useState
*) whenever setter function is triggered, React re renders the component


EX:
const[      count,       setCount] =     useState(0)
      default value  setter function         default value 



UPDATING A STATE:
*) when ever v create a usestate with default value of {} or [], javascript see that v want to create a array and assignes a array memory in our computer


*************** refer photo error state ****************


*) next whn v try to update the array using push or any inbuild array methods. the array get updated but the state never changes
*) because the usestate reference the same state
*) react has this unique property wch if the state is referncing to the same memory space in memoery than it does not re render the component
 
SOLUTION TO this
*) create a new array refernceing a new memory space than use that memeory space to update the state
