What is a component:
component are a resuable pieces of UI containing both design logic and business logic

Virtual DOM VS Real DOM
Real DOM
First things first, DOM stands for “Document Object Model”. The DOM in simple words represents the UI of your application. Everytime there is a change in the state of your application UI, the DOM gets updated to represent that change.

Virtual DOM
The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM. Everytime the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.
When new elements are added to the UI, a virtual DOM, which is represented as a tree is created. Each element is a node on this tree. If the state of any of these elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created. This tree is then compared or “diffed” with the previous virtual DOM tree.

EX: lets say u have 4 input fields.. n update the 1st input field now the virtual dom  will look at the updated state and it will compare it with the previous DOM and update oly the change state rather than re-rending the entire component
